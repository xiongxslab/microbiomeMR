# microbiomeMR
The gut microbiome plays fundamental roles in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the interaction between microbiome and host gene expression, and the molecular mechanism underlying the disease regulation remain largely unclear. Here, we integrate the genetic regulatory maps of 116 microbial genera with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) in three intestinal tissues to dissect the crosstalk between host gene regulation and microbiome composition.

## MR
The Code for bi-directional MR analysis between gene expression and microbiome, as well as between microbiome and methylation implemented by R package TwoSampleMR (v0.5.6). 
TwoSampleMR is available at https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR.
## HEIDI test
The code for conducting heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test, implemented using the SMR software. 
SMR can be accessed at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr.
## Coloc
The code for conducting Bayesian-based colocalization analysis between gene expression and the microbiome, as well as between microbiome and methylation using the R package coloc (v5.2.2), is provided. 
coloc can be found at https://chr1swallace.github.io/coloc.
## Moloc
Code for multiple trait colocalization analysis among gene expression, microbiome, and diseases/traits, as well as across microbiome, methylation and gene expression implemented by R package moloc (version 0.1.0). 
moloc is avaliable at https://github.com/clagiamba/moloc.
## MR examples
We select the MR result of the chromosome 12 gene expression-to-microbiome composition in transverse colon as an example. 
## Browser
An interactive website is available to visualize and download the results from the paper.
