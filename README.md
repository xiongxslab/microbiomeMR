# microbiomeMR
## MR
code for the Code for bi-directional MR analysis between gene expression and microbiome implemented by R package TwoSampleMR (v0.5.6). 
TwoSampleMR is available at https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR.
## HEIDI test
The code for conducting heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test between gene expression and the microbiome composition, implemented using the SMR software. 
SMR can be accessed at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/smr.
## Coloc
The code for conducting Bayesian-based colocalization analysis between gene expression and the microbiome, using the R package coloc (v5.2.2), is provided. 
coloc can be found at https://chr1swallace.github.io/coloc.
## Moloc
Code for multiple trait colocalization analysis among gene expression, microbiome, and diseases/traits implemented by R package moloc (version 0.1.0). 
moloc is avaliable at https://github.com/clagiamba/moloc.
## MR examples
We select the MR result of the chromosome 12 gene expression-to-microbiome composition in transverse colon as an example.
